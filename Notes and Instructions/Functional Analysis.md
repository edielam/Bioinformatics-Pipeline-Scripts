# Functional Analysis and Visualization

This will guide you through the process of performing functional analysis and visualization of annotated variants. Starting from the annotated variants in CSV format, we will cover gene prioritization, variant filtering, functional prediction, pathway and gene set enrichment analysis, and protein structure analysis. The tutorial assumes you have basic knowledge of bioinformatics concepts and have the necessary tools and data files installed.

## Step 1: Annotated Variants in CSV Format

Assuming you have the annotated variants in CSV format, make sure the file contains the necessary columns such as `CHROM`, `POS`, `REF`, `ALT`, `GENE`, `VARIANT_TYPE`, `CONSEQUENCE`, and `CLINICAL_SIGNIFICANCE`. If needed, you can customize the column names and adjust the subsequent code accordingly.

## Step 2: Gene Prioritization and Variant Filtering

To prioritize genes of interest and filter variants based on specific criteria, follow these steps:

1. Load the annotated variant data into a DataFrame using a Python library like pandas.
2. Define a list of genes of interest.
3. Filter the DataFrame based on the genes of interest using the `isin()` function.
4. Additional filtering can be performed based on variant type, predicted impact, clinical significance, or any other criteria of interest.

## Step 3: Functional Prediction

For functional prediction of variants, follow these steps:

1. Install the CADD tool and download the CADD data file.
2. Load the CADD data file (CADD scores) into a DataFrame.
3. Merge the CADD scores with the filtered variant data using common columns such as `CHROM`, `POS`, `REF`, and `ALT`.

### CADD Tool and CADD Data File

The CADD (Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion) tool is used for predicting the deleteriousness of genetic variants. It integrates various annotations to estimate the pathogenicity of variants and assigns a CADD score to each variant.

A "CADD data file" refers to a file that contains pre-calculated CADD scores for genomic variants. These scores are used to annotate and predict the functional impact of variants. The file typically includes information such as chromosome number, position, reference allele, alternative allele, and the associated CADD score for each variant.

To access the CADD tool and obtain the CADD data file, you can visit the official CADD website (https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/) for more information and instructions on downloading the necessary files and accessing the CADD scores.



## Step 4: Pathway and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

Performing pathway and gene set enrichment analysis can provide insights into the functional implications of the variants. Here's how you can do it:

1. Install the gseapy Python library for gene set enrichment analysis.
2. Extract the gene symbols from the filtered DataFrame.
3. Perform gene set enrichment analysis using g:Profiler or other enrichment analysis tools.
4. Retrieve and explore the enriched pathways or gene sets to identify relevant biological processes.

## Step 5: Protein Structure Analysis

Analyzing the impact of variants on protein structure can provide structural insights. Here's how you can visualize the protein structure:

1. Install the py3Dmol Python library for protein structure visualization.
2. Obtain the protein structure file in PDB format.
3. Load the protein structure file using py3Dmol.
4. Identify the residues affected by missense variants from the filtered DataFrame.
5. Highlight the affected residues in the protein structure using the appropriate py3Dmol functions.
6. Visualize and explore the protein structure with the highlighted residues.

## Conclusion

By following this, you can perform functional analysis and visualization of annotated variants, enabling you to gain insights into the potential impact of genetic variants on genes, pathways, and protein structure. The results obtained from these analyses can be used for further interpretation, validation, and reporting in your research paper.
